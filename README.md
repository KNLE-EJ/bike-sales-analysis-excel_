## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning was performed using Power Query to ensure consistency and accuracy. Key steps included:
- Removing duplicate records  
- Standardising categorical values  
- Handling missing or irrelevant data  
- Grouping ages into meaningful bands  
- Ensuring correct data types for analysis  

## Key Insights
